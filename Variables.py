'''

x = 5
y = 6
print(x + y)

'''
2.In python , we do not have to define the data type of it

'''
3. We can do index opertions in string variaable
'''
x = "ruchir"
print(x[0])
print(x[-2])  #negative indexing startes with end position
print(x[2:5])
print(x[-3:-1])

'''
4. Strings are immutable

We cant do x[1] = 'a'

To find the length of a string use len function
'''

print(len(x))
